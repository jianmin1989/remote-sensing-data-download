Created by Dr. Jianmin Wang jianmin.wang@sdstate.edu
for downloading data from USGS earthexploer (EE)

1. You need an EE account and save the credentials as cookie.txt
2. You need to use the website interface to create a list of files using their filters. You explore all the filtered files as CSV. The codes will use the CSV information to interpret the download links and file names
3. At the time these codes were created, there were no batch download tools from the USGS. Now, it seems like USGS provides an official bulk download tools. Try them out.
